                        Every year, across the globe, almost every nation engages in the global arms trade. 
                        While this may conjure images of black market deals and shady crates being handed over on shadier docks, 
                        the reality of modern arms production is that the vast majority of modern systems cannot be produced anywhere. 
                        Between the restrictions placed on a countries armies by its governments alliances, to the practical difficulties
                        involved in manufacturing high tech weapons systems, many countries have no choice but to resort to their neighbours 
                        for arms, and many others simply decide that a second hand system, or one produced by an ally is a more fiscally reasonable 
                        choice.

                        <p>
                            As many countries either find themselves unable to produce every possible weapon system their repective 
                            armed forces could need, or unable to do so with the quality of some of their neighbours, they elect 
                            instead to import these systems. Importing countries can expect to burn billions of taxpayer dollars on
                            even relatively modest systems, and as more and more advanced systems get developed, this cost only increases.
                            <br><br>The imports of a country therefore depend little on where it is in the global arms production world. with 
                            even china, russia and the USA importing billions of dollars worth of material. <br><br>

                        <h2>international arms exports</h2>
                        <p>
                            Unlike imports, exports are heavily biased towards large economies with a high tech manufacturing base.
                            These economies have to balance production both for themselves and allies, and so the econimic investment 
                            required to make such deals practical is exhorbitant. In countries like the USA the military industrial complex
                            is one of the largest employers in the country, and has ties to nearly every business sector in it. 
                            <br><br>Because of the specialisation needed to make comercial exports long term viable, 
                            only a few countries are able to export a significant number or value of arms consistantly.
